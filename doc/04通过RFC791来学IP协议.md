##### 3.1、Internet Header Format

+ 重点是**Options**，这部分对应《Linux内核源码剖析-TCP/IP实现》的12.1节，*只是文字和举例部分*，看函数的实现，*我在这些里面，暂时还没有找到*

##### 3.2、Discussion

###### Fragmentation and Reassembly 分片和组装

+ The internet identification field (ID) is used together with the source and destination address, and the protocol fields, to identify datagram fragments for reassembly.
  + The internet identification field (ID) 跟源地址、目标地址和协议域一起使用，用来标识数据重组中的分片。 【*他们组成一起来标识分片*】

+ The More Fragments flag bit (MF) is set if the datagram is not the last fragment.  The Fragment Offset field identifies the fragment location, relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented datagram.  Fragments are counted in units of 8 octets.  The fragmentation strategy is designed so than an unfragmented datagram has all zero fragmentation information (MF = 0, fragment offset = 0).  If an internet datagram is fragmented, its data portion must be broken on 8 octet boundaries.
  + 数据报不是最后的分片，置MF标志
  + The Fragment Offset field标识了，相对于原始未分片数据报的位置
  + 分片的以8 octets统计
  + 分片的策略被设计为
  + 数据片分片要以8为边界？

+ This format allows `2**13 = 8192` fragments of 8 octets each for a  total of 65,536 octets.  Note that this is consistent with the the datagram total length field (of course, the header is counted in the total length and not in the fragments).
  + 规范允许8192个分片，每个8个，总共是65536
  + 考虑到报文的总长度（头也算在总长度里）
+ When fragmentation occurs, some options are copied, but others remain with the first fragment only.
  + 当发生分片，一些选项被复制，有些只在第一次时保留？
+ Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68
  octets without further fragmentation.  This is because an internet
  header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.
  + 不超过68octets时不需要分片
  + ip的头部是60 octets，最小分片是8 octets
+ Every internet destination must be able to receive a datagram of 576
  octets either in one piece or in fragments to be reassembled.
  + 目的必须能接收576 octets，不管是一片还是分配组装后的
+ The fields which may be affected by fragmentation include:  【影响分片的字段】
    (1) options field
    (2) more fragments flag
    (3) fragment offset
    (4) internet header length field
    (5) total length field
    (6) header checksum
+ If the Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit is set, then internet
  fragmentation of this datagram is NOT permitted, although it may be
  discarded.  This can be used to prohibit fragmentation in cases
  where the receiving host does not have sufficient resources to
  reassemble internet fragments.
  + DF标记是不能被分片
  + 万一接收主机没有足够的资源组装分片时，用来禁止分片
+ One example of use of the Don't Fragment feature is to down line
  load a small host.  A small host could have a boot strap program
  that accepts a datagram stores it in memory and then executes it.
  + *down line load a small host*，没懂
+ The fragmentation and reassembly procedures are most easily
  described by examples.  The following procedures are example
  implementations.
  + 举了例子说明过程
+ General notation（表示） in the following pseudo programs: "=<" means "less
  than or equal", "#" means "not equal", "=" means "equal", "<-" means
  "is set to".  Also, "x to y" includes x and excludes y; for example,
  "4 to 7" would include 4, 5, and 6 (but not 7).

######  An Example Fragmentation Procedure

+ The maximum sized datagram that can be transmitted through the next network is called the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
  + 网络传输通过的最大尺寸的数据报称为MTU
+ If the total length is less than or equal the maximum transmission unit then submit this datagram to the next step in datagram processing; otherwise cut the datagram into two fragments, the first fragment being the maximum size, and the second fragment being the rest of the datagram.  The first fragment is submitted to the next step in datagram processing, while the second fragment is submitted to this procedure in case it is still too large.
  + 如果总长度小于或等于MTU，提交数据报到下步在数据报处理，否则数据报切2片，第一片是最大，第二片是剩下的。
  + 把第一片提交到下一步，在数据报处理中
  + 同时第二片提交到此过程，万一它还是大呢
  + *所谓的next step是啥意思，我没太懂*
+ 过程（*我大概抽象一下*），*再结合书看一下*
  + 0、**了解一下变量含义和伪代码符号，表达的信息**
  + 1、处理第一个分片
  + 2、处理第二个分片

            FO    -  Fragment Offset
            IHL   -  Internet Header Length
            DF    -  Don't Fragment flag

            MTU   -  Maximum Transmission Unit
    
          Procedure:
    
            IF TL =< MTU THEN Submit this datagram to the next step in datagram processing ELSE IF DF = 1 THEN discard the datagram ELSE
            To produce the first fragment:
            (1)  Copy the original internet header;
            (2)  OIHL <- IHL; OTL <- TL; OFO <- FO; OMF <- MF;
            (3)  NFB <- (MTU-IHL*4)/8;  赋值给分片的数字
            (4)  Attach the first NFB*8 data octets;  追加第一个
            (5)  Correct the header:
                 MF <- 1;  TL <- (IHL*4)+(NFB*8);
                 Recompute Checksum;
            (6)  Submit this fragment to the next step in datagram processing;
            To produce the second fragment:
            (7)  Selectively copy the internet header (some options are not copied, see option definitions);
            (8)  Append the remaining data;
            (9)  Correct the header:
                 IHL <- (((OIHL*4)-(length of options not copied))+3)/4;
                 TL <- OTL - NFB*8 - (OIHL-IHL)*4);
                 FO <- OFO + NFB;  MF <- OMF;  Recompute Checksum;
            (10) Submit this fragment to the fragmentation test; DONE.
+ In the above procedure each fragment (except the last) was made the maximum allowable size.  An alternative might produce less than the maximum size datagrams.  For example, one could implement a fragmentation procedure that repeatly divided large datagrams in half until the resulting fragments were less than the maximum transmission unit size.
  + 除了最后一个分片，都是最大的
  + 另一种可能的选择，*这句话，没懂*
  + 举例，一旦实现了一个分片过程，重复的除以最大数据报的一半，直到结果分片小于MTU的大小

###### An Example Reassembly Procedure

```
      For each datagram the buffer identifier is computed as the
      concatenation of the source, destination, protocol, and
      identification fields.  If this is a whole datagram (that is both
      the fragment offset and the more fragments  fields are zero), then
      any reassembly resources associated with this buffer identifier
      are released and the datagram is forwarded to the next step in
      datagram processing.

      If no other fragment with this buffer identifier is on hand then
      reassembly resources are allocated.  The reassembly resources
      consist of a data buffer, a header buffer, a fragment block bit
      table, a total data length field, and a timer.  The data from the
      fragment is placed in the data buffer according to its fragment
      offset and length, and bits are set in the fragment block bit
      table corresponding to the fragment blocks received.

      If this is the first fragment (that is the fragment offset is
      zero)  this header is placed in the header buffer.  If this is the
      last fragment ( that is the more fragments field is zero) the
      total data length is computed.  If this fragment completes the
      datagram (tested by checking the bits set in the fragment block
      table), then the datagram is sent to the next step in datagram
      processing; otherwise the timer is set to the maximum of the
      current timer value and the value of the time to live field from
      this fragment; and the reassembly routine gives up control.

      If the timer runs out, the all reassembly resources for this
      buffer identifier are released.  The initial setting of the timer
      is a lower bound on the reassembly waiting time.  This is because
      the waiting time will be increased if the Time to Live in the
      arriving fragment is greater than the current timer value but will
      not be decreased if it is less.  The maximum this timer value
      could reach is the maximum time to live (approximately 4.25
      minutes).  The current recommendation for the initial timer
      setting is 15 seconds.  This may be changed as experience with
      this protocol accumulates.  Note that the choice of this parameter
      value is related to the buffer capacity available and the data
      rate of the transmission medium; that is, data rate times timer
      value equals buffer size (e.g., 10Kb/s X 15s = 150Kb).

      Notation:

        FO    -  Fragment Offset
        IHL   -  Internet Header Length
        MF    -  More Fragments flag
        TTL   -  Time To Live
        NFB   -  Number of Fragment Blocks
        TL    -  Total Length
        TDL   -  Total Data Length
        BUFID -  Buffer Identifier
        RCVBT -  Fragment Received Bit Table
        TLB   -  Timer Lower Bound

      Procedure:

        (1)  BUFID <- source|destination|protocol|identification;
        (2)  IF FO = 0 AND MF = 0
        (3)     THEN IF buffer with BUFID is allocated
        (4)             THEN flush all reassembly for this BUFID;
        (5)          Submit datagram to next step; DONE.
        (6)     ELSE IF no buffer with BUFID is allocated
        (7)             THEN allocate reassembly resources
                             with BUFID;
                             TIMER <- TLB; TDL <- 0;
        (8)          put data from fragment into data buffer with
                     BUFID from octet FO*8 to
                                         octet (TL-(IHL*4))+FO*8;
        (9)          set RCVBT bits from FO
                                        to FO+((TL-(IHL*4)+7)/8);
        (10)         IF MF = 0 THEN TDL <- TL-(IHL*4)+(FO*8)
        (11)         IF FO = 0 THEN put header in header buffer
        (12)         IF TDL # 0
        (13)          AND all RCVBT bits from 0
                                             to (TDL+7)/8 are set
        (14)            THEN TL <- TDL+(IHL*4)
        (15)                 Submit datagram to next step;
        (16)                 free all reassembly resources
                             for this BUFID; DONE.
        (17)         TIMER <- MAX(TIMER,TTL);
        (18)         give up until next fragment or timer expires;
        (19) timer expires: flush all reassembly with this BUFID; DONE.

      In the case that two or more fragments contain the same data
      either identically or through a partial overlap, this procedure
      will use the more recently arrived copy in the data buffer and
      datagram delivered.
